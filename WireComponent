each one of these objects will represent some piece of wire
for now it will only be able to represent some sort of voltage 
source and some resistance.  So resistive sources can be modeled
as well as ideal motive sources and ideal resistors.  The first
new stuff to come would be current souces then other linear 
components like inductors and capacitors!

I'm also considering adding a special characteristics for 
material type and length to accound for natural wire resitance
